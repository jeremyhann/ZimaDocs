## Remote Access

Accessibility is foundational for private clouds, and configuring network settings on most NAS devices can be quite complex. ZimaOS aims to offer a plug-and-play remote access experience that is both secure and reliable, without any risk of cloud forwarding or data leakage.

Thus, once you install the Zima Client application and scan to connect to ZimaOS for the first time, your remote access channel is already set up!
