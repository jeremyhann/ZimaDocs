## How to Manually Download the Large Language Model

Assist currently uses the "TheBloke/Llama-2-13b-Chat-GPTQ" by default for ZimaOS.
It can be downloaded manually and copied to the "/DATA/Assist/model/models--TheBloke--Llama-2-13b-Chat-GPTQ" folder on the Zima device at [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ)
