## Meet immich's UI

Basically, you can say immich is pretty like Google Photos' UI.

On the left, you will find the navigation column, which classifies your photos by location(Map), Favorites, etc.

On the top, you can search your photos by people, context, country, etc.

The most important thing is that you can install the mobile app, which not only implements the upload and browsing functions mentioned above, but also helps you automatically backup your photos continuously!
